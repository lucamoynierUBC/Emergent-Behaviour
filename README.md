# Emergent-Behaviour
### Rules of Bees: 1: If encounter another bee stop moving. 
###                2: if encounter heat source/sun stop moving slightly longer
###                3: move randomly 

## I created this project after learning about this sample of emergent behaviour in one of my cognitive systems courses at UBC. I want to see if using the algorithm described above, could emergent behaviour be achieved?
